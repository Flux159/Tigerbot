This is a git repository for Tigerbot. It currently only contains the iPhone applicaiton created for Tigerbot (currently in the TIGERbotNoServer folder).

In time, we will move our googlecode repository (containing our PIC code and ARMcode) over to this github repository.

For more information about Tigerbot, see the wiki at: https://github.com/Flux159/Tigerbot/wiki (or read below):

Tigerbot: "Trajectory-based Intuitive Gesture Enabled Robot"

Tigerbot is an iPhone controlled robot that can follow a path given on the screen. The robot was created using a TI Beagleboard and a custom designed PCB board using 2 PIC microcontrollers. It connects to the iPhone through a USB wifi interface connected to the beagleboard.

Tigerbot was created at CMU by Suyog Sonwalkar and Kevin Yuan Li for the ECE Build 18 event, a Carnegie Mellon University Electrical and Computer Engineering department sponsored event in which groups of students can build any project they can think of.
